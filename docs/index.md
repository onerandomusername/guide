## Pre-Required Knowledge

While we appreciate the process of making Discord bots, creating a bot with `disnake` requires a decent amount of
experience on working with Python and object-oriented programming. You _can_ go forward and make a bot with little to no
knowledge of Python or programming, but doing so will only hinder your progress and cause issues in the future.

If you don't know Python but would like to learn more, here are a few resources to get you started:

-   [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html), a free online book.
-   [Codecademy's course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) for learning Python 3.
-   [LearnPython](https://www.learnpython.org/), an interactive tutorial for absolute beginners.
-   [A Byte of Python by Swaroop C.H.](https://python.swaroopch.com/), an introductory text for people with no previous
    programming experience.

An extensive list of these resources can be found on
[Python's official website](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers). Once you're more experienced
with Python, you can come back here to get started!
