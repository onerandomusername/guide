# Embeds

You might have seen some special messages on Discord (often sent by bots/webhooks), that have a colored border, embedded
images, text fields and other properties. These elements are referred to as **Embeds**, and this section will cover how
you can create and send one with your bot. This is done with the {py:class}`disnake.Embed` class.

This section will extensively cover the attributes and methods used with embeds. Thus, we recommend skipping to your
desired topic via the table of contents.

## Embed preview

Here is an example of how an embed may look. We will go over embed construction in the next part of this article.

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/001.png
:width: 70%
```

The code for this embed is given below.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
# At the top of the file.
import disnake
from disnake.ext import commands

# Inside a command, event listener, etc.
embed = disnake.Embed(
    title="Embed Title",
    description="Embed Description",
    color=disnake.Colour.yellow(),
    timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(),
)

embed.set_author(
    name="Embed Author",
    url="https://disnake.dev/",
    icon_url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png",
)
embed.set_footer(
    text="Embed Footer",
    icon_url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png",
)

embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png")
embed.set_image(url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-thin-banner.png")

embed.add_field(name="Regular Title", value="Regular Value", inline=False)
embed.add_field(name="Inline Title", value="Inline Value", inline=True)
embed.add_field(name="Inline Title", value="Inline Value", inline=True)
embed.add_field(name="Inline Title", value="Inline Value", inline=True)

await ctx.send(embed=embed)
```

```{note}

It is not strictly necessary to use all elements showcased above. You're free to leave some out as per your requirements.
```

The colour of the embed (via the `colour` parameter) accepts a {py:class}`disnake.Colour` instance, a HEX string or an
integer.

To add a blank field to the embed, you can use `embed.add_field(name='\u200b', value='\u200b')`.

## Creating an embed

You can use the {py:class}`disnake.Embed` instance for the creation and manipulation of embeds.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
embed = disnake.Embed(
    title="An Embed!",
    description="A description!",
    colour=0xF0C43F,
)
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/002.png
:width: 33%
```

### Setting the author

You can set the author of the embed with the {py:meth}`disnake.Embed.set_author` attribute. Note that this code will
come after you have defined `embed` via `embed = disnake.Embed(...)`.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
embed.set_author(
    name="Embed Author",
    url="https://disnake.dev/",
    icon_url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png",
)
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/003.png
:width: 34%
```

Since we have set a URL in this case, clicking on "Embed Author" will redirect the user to the
[`disnake.dev`](https://disnake.dev/) website.

### Setting the footer

You can set the footer of the embed with the {py:meth}`disnake.Embed.set_footer`] attribute. Note that this code will
come after you have defined `embed` via `embed = disnake.Embed(...)`.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
embed.set_footer(
    text="Embed Footer",
    icon_url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png",
)
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/004.png
   :width: 33%
```

### Setting the thumbnail

The thumbnail of the embed is shown in it's top right corner. It can be set using the
{py:meth}`disnake.Embed.set_thumbnail` attribute.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-thin-banner.png")
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/005.png
   :width: 74%
```

### Using timestamps

Timestamps are shown in the footer of the embed, indicating the time at which the embed was sent/initiated. This can be
done using the {py:attr}`disnake.Embed.timestamp`] attribute of {py:class}`disnake.Embed`. Its also a parameter.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py" hl_lines="9"
# At the top of your script
import datetime

# Inside a command, event listener, etc.
embed = disnake.Embed(
    title="An Embed!",
    description="A description!",
    colour=0xF0C43F,
    timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(),
)
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/006.png
   :width: 74%
```

### Inserting fields

Embed fields have two parameters - a name(or title) and a value, inside the {py:meth}`disnake.Embed.add_field`
attribute. It is also possible to use markdown in both parameters.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
# Regular Fields
embed.add_field(name="Regular Title", value="Regular Value", inline=False)

# Inline Fields
embed.add_field(name="Inline Title", value="Inline Value", inline=True)
embed.add_field(name="Inline Title", value="Inline Value", inline=True)
embed.add_field(name="Inline Title", value="Inline Value", inline=True)
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/007.png
   :width: 55%
```

These attributes also fully support the use of markdown, as well as highlight links. You can also insert fields at a
particular position, with a specified index using {py:meth}`disnake.Embed.insert_field_at`.

### Inserting images

This can be done using the {py:meth}`disnake.Embed.set_image` attribute, which accepts either a URL or a
{py:class}`disnake.File` object.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
# Using a URL
embed.set_image(url="https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-thin-banner.png")

# Using a local file
embed.set_image(file=disnake.File("path/to/file.png"))
```

```{image} /assets/img-embeds/008.png
   :width: 72%
```

## Sending an embed

Once the embed is created, you need to send it to a channel too. This means you need to call `send(embed=embed)` on a
messageable object, for example a `TextChannel` object (i.e. `message.channel.send`) or a `Context` object (`ctx.send`).
Otherwise, the embed will not be sent.

## Dictionaries to embeds

A `dict` datatype (and essentially a `json` file) can be converted into an embed, using the
{py:meth}`disnake.Embed.from_dict` method. We can recreate the embed made at the start of this page, using the same.

```python linenums="1" title="embed.py"
embed_dict = {
    "title": "Embed Title",
    "description": "Embed Description",
    "color": 0xFEE75C,
    "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "author": {
        "name": "Embed Author",
        "url": "https://disnake.dev/",
        "icon_url": "https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png",
    },
    "thumbnail": {"url": "https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png"},
    "fields": [
        {"name": "Regular Title", "value": "Regular Value", "inline": "false"},
        {"name": "Inline Title", "value": "Inline Value", "inline": "true"},
        {"name": "Inline Title", "value": "Inline Value", "inline": "true"},
        {"name": "Inline Title", "value": "Inline Value", "inline": "true"},
    ],
    "image": {"url": "https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-thin-banner.png"},
    "footer": {"text": "Embed Footer", "icon_url": "https://disnake.dev/assets/disnake-logo.png"},
}

await channel.send(embed=disnake.Embed.from_dict(embed_dict))
```

This will give the exact same result as the embed shown [here](./#embed-preview). Note that the timestamp passed through
a dictionary should be in ISO8601 format (which has been achieved here by using `datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()`).
You can learn more about the `dict` format of embeds in the
{disdocs}`official Discord documentation </resources/channel#embed-object>`.

## Embed notes

-   To display fields side-by-side, you need at least two consecutive fields set to inline.
-   The timestamp will automatically adjust the timezone depending on the user's device.
-   Mentions of any kind in embeds will only render correctly within embed descriptions and field values.
-   Mentions in embeds will not trigger a notification.
-   Embeds allow masked links (e.g. `[Guide](https://guide.disnake.dev/ 'optional hovertext'`)), but only in description
    and field values.

## Embed limits

There are a few limits to be aware of while planning your embeds due to the API's limitations. Here is a quick reference
you can come back to:

-   Embed titles are limited to 256 characters.
-   Embed descriptions are limited to 4096 characters.
-   There can be up to 25 fields.
-   A field's name is limited to 256 characters and its value to 1024 characters.
-   The footer text is limited to 2048 characters.
-   The author name is limited to 256 characters.
-   The sum of all characters from all embed structures in a message must not exceed 6000 characters.
-   Ten embeds can be sent per message.
